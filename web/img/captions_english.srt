lobbying is about foresight but

45
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,750
anticipating your opponents moves and

46
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,040
devising countermeasures

47
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,169
the winner plots one step ahead of the

48
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:42,680
opposition and plays her trump card

49
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,509
just after they play there's

50
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,550
you better not be saying that when

51
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,250
you're in there it's about making sure

52
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,479
you surprise them and they don't

00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:00,789
surprise you the Ted Bundy story has

54
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:04,030
been recycled over and over and over

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,849
again it makes for a great entertainment

56
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:10,330
he's a fascinating evil character

57
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,810
it's a discounting of the stories of the

58
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,770
women in favour of the central hero

59
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,590
being the most important character in

60
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,259
the narrative and that is the failure to

61
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,710
look deeper and think harder about

62
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:31,259
violence against women in our culture
