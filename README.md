## Description:

AmaSync is a chrome extension for watching Amazon Prime Video remotely with your friends.
It has the following functionalities:

- Create rooms
- Join your friend's room
- Real time synchronization of movies/series
- Chats in room
- Cutomizable name of users

## Deployment

### Prerequisites:

Nodejs >= 10, npm, react

### Local deployment:

- Clone this repo
- #### Generate SSL certificate

```bash
openssl genrsa -out key.pem
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem
openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem
rm csr.pem
```

- Change the routes to the certificate on `amasync/server/bin/www` file
- Run the following commands

  ```bash
  cd amasync
  cd server
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

- Go to https://localhost:8080 and allow the self-signed certificate in your browser. It will say it's insecure because it was generated locally, but it's ok (don't trust the browser, trust me bro 🙊).

- Ypu can test that it's working creating a websocket in your **browser console**

        let ws= new WebSocket('wss://localhost:8080')

You're all set 😉
